# Editor Area Performance Refactoring

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Performance Optimizations

**Problem**: Monaco editor keystrokes were extremely slow due to direct Zustand store updates on every keystroke.

**Solution**: 
- Created `useBufferSyncManager` hook that maintains local state and debounces store updates (500ms delay)
- Minimized Zustand subscriptions by using specific selectors instead of broad store subscriptions
- Separated Monaco editor logic into `CodeEditor` component with optimized re-rendering

### 2. Content Architecture Refactoring

**Problem**: Mixed code and non-code content handling in a single editor component.

**Solution**:
- Created `ContentRenderer` component that routes to appropriate content handler
- Created `CodeEditor` for text/code files with Monaco
- Created `ContentViewer` for images, videos, audio, PDFs, and binary files
- Extended `BufferType` to include `video` and `audio` types

### 3. Key Components Created

1. **`CodeEditor`** (`code-editor.tsx`)
   - High-performance Monaco editor with debounced sync
   - LSP integration for TypeScript/JavaScript
   - Keybindings and theme support
   - Focus management

2. **`ContentViewer`** (`content-viewer.tsx`)
   - Image viewer with zoom/pan
   - Video/audio players
   - PDF viewer (iframe-based)
   - Binary file info display

3. **`ContentRenderer`** (`content-renderer.tsx`)
   - Smart routing between CodeEditor and ContentViewer
   - Based on buffer type and editability

4. **`useBufferSyncManager`** (`hooks/useBufferSyncManager.ts`)
   - Debounced sync to prevent store thrashing
   - Local state management for editor content
   - External change detection and sync
   - Dirty state tracking

### 4. Buffer Type System Extended

Extended `BufferType` to support:
- `video`: MP4, AVI, MOV, WebM, etc.
- `audio`: MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, etc.
- Updated MIME type detection
- Updated file extension mappings

### 5. Performance Benefits

- **Reduced Store Updates**: Editor changes are debounced (500ms) instead of immediate
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Components only subscribe to specific data they need
- **Local State**: Monaco editor maintains local content, syncing periodically
- **External Sync**: Still supports external modifications (LLM agents, other splits)
- **Memory Efficiency**: Better garbage collection with proper cleanup

### 6. Future Extensibility

The new architecture makes it easy to add:
- More content viewers (3D models, spreadsheets, etc.)
- Custom editors for specific file types
- Preview modes and split editing
- Real-time collaboration features

## Usage

The refactored `EditorPane` now automatically:
1. Uses `ContentRenderer` to choose appropriate component
2. Provides focus management
3. Handles both code and non-code content seamlessly

## Migration Notes

- Existing `Editor` component is replaced by `CodeEditor`
- `EditorPane` now uses `ContentRenderer` 
- Performance should be dramatically improved for typing
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Non-code files now have proper viewers instead of error states
