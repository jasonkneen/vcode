# Agent Details Modal to Sheet Conversion

## Summary of Changes

I have successfully converted the agent details modal to a sheet on the right side and improved the conversation display to better match the chat message patterns. Here are the key changes made:

## 1. Modal to Sheet Conversion

### Files Changed:
- **Renamed**: `agent-details-modal.tsx` â†’ `agent-details-sheet.tsx`
- **Updated**: Replaced Dialog components with Sheet components
- **Layout**: Changed to a right-side sheet with better width (`600px`)

### Key Improvements:
- Right-side sliding sheet instead of center modal
- Better space utilization for conversation viewing
- Improved responsive design
- More natural workflow for reviewing agent conversations

## 2. New Agent-Specific Components

### Created Three New Components:

#### `agent-message-renderer.tsx`
- Similar to `chat-message.tsx` but tailored for agent contexts
- Handles different message roles: `user`, `assistant`, `tool`, `system`
- Better visual distinction between role types with color coding
- Includes step indexing to track agent progression
- Tool call integration with expandable details

#### `agent-tool-call-handler.tsx`
- Agent-specific version of tool call display
- Shows tool execution state (running, completed, error)
- Expandable tool details with arguments and results
- Better visual hierarchy for understanding agent actions
- Supports various tool types (file operations, searches, commands)

#### `agent-markdown-renderer.tsx`
- Optimized markdown rendering for agent content
- Custom code block component with copy functionality
- Smaller, more compact styling appropriate for side panel
- Agent-specific CSS styling

## 3. Enhanced Message Display

### Improvements over Original:
- **Role-based styling**: Each message role has distinct visual treatment
- **Tool call visibility**: Clear display of what tools the agent executed
- **Progress tracking**: Step numbers help understand agent workflow
- **Structured content**: Better handling of tool results and JSON data
- **Expandable details**: Users can drill down into tool execution details

### Message Types Handled:
1. **User messages**: Blue-tinted background with user icon
2. **Assistant messages**: Green-tinted background with bot icon  
3. **Tool messages**: Orange-tinted background with tool icon
4. **System messages**: Purple-tinted background with settings icon

## 4. State Management Updates

### Updated AgentsView component:
- Renamed state variables for clarity (`detailsSheetOpen` vs `detailsModalOpen`)
- Updated handler function names to match sheet paradigm
- Maintained all existing functionality

## 5. Export Structure

### Updated exports.ts:
- Added exports for new components
- Fixed duplicate identifier issue with `AgentProgress` type
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing imports

## 6. Styling Enhancements

### Created `agent-markdown-content.css`:
- Agent-specific markdown styling
- Compact design suitable for side panels
- Consistent with application's design system
- Better code block and table styling

## Technical Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Side sheet doesn't block the main interface
2. **Improved Readability**: Agent conversations are easier to follow
3. **Tool Transparency**: Users can clearly see what agents did
4. **Scalable Design**: New components can be reused elsewhere
5. **Maintainable Code**: Separate concerns for different message types

## Usage

The sheet opens on the right side when viewing agent details, displaying:
- Agent metadata (creation date, project, progress)
- Progress timeline with status indicators
- Enhanced conversation history with tool call details
- Message input for agent interaction (when applicable)

This implementation provides much better visibility into agent behavior and makes it easier to understand what actions agents have taken during their execution.
